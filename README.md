# TFiCA
Final Project (Most Frugal Explanations vs Hierarchical Beam Search)

## Problems:
* Figure out how to connect co-occurrencies with Feature array
* Entering evidence for co-occurances leads to lower probabilities (due to all the multiplications) compared to the co-occurances that the evidence is not entered for. (maybe a problem)

## Todo:
* Create dag links 
* update node sizes
*
