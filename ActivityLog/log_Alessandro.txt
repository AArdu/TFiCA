I had a look to limid,
but using them makes no sense because the decision nodes would be determined by the evidence in the board.

# main.m

adds paths for BN toolbox
initialize agent (BN) and opponent (greedy algorithm)
updates probabilities on past feature nodes

start game routine:

TODO agent asks question (now randomly)
opponent checks for answer and returns a break command if guessed character is correct

TODO agent updates its gameboard: still to be determined if changing CPD or other
opponent asks question about thing that has highest prob
check if opponent's question is correct
update opponent's board
check if any winner

# Functions/create_BN.m

reconnected co-occurrences nodes
TODO which are observed nodes really?

# Functions/initializePlayers.m

TODO create a method to select mystery characters with a criterion?

# Functions/updateBoard.m

removes characters and features from board according to the answer, returning updated board with remaining candidates

# FUnctions/Opponent.m

produce answer to question produced by agent by simple comparison
formulates question to agent asking highest probaility candidate among features and characters

# Functions/Agent.m

nothing for now
